# *TADS-Cofo-ED1*

## - [ ] **Learning data structures!** :green_circle:
* Basically, a cofo is a bag where you can put many things.
* There will be different implementations of the "cofo" idea in C for the "Estruturas de Dados I"'s subject.

* The first implementation of this is basically an integer array.
* The second one is a generic array that stores the memory adress of the items.
* The third one is a stack (so interesting).
* The fourth is a linear queue (really simple).
* The fifth one is a circular queue.

* I'm really happy about the terminal app :D
* You can see its evolution through each cofo.
* It has functions to create the cofo, destroy it, insert something on it, remove something and find a specific element on it, and many others that depend on the structure.

* The sixth is a single linked list. It's kinda simple to use.
* With it, we have nodes and the proper list. Now we don't have a limit to its extension.
* The task was to implement something tha resolves the n-queens' problem (it was kinda fun to do).

* The seventh one is a binary search tree.
* It was the hardest to do and one othe funniest :D
* It's one of the most important data structures.

As the license suggests, everything here is on public domain so you can use the code and everythng.
Thank you :D
